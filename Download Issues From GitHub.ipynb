Ask them on Stack Overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/snakemake -->\\r\\n\\r\\n**Snakemake version**\\r\\n<!--Note the Snakemake version for which you experience the bug.\\r\\nPlease only report bugs of the **latest stable release of Snakemake**.\\r\\nIf possible please check whether the bug has been already fixed in the main branch.-->\\r\\n\\r\\nSnakemake Version: 8.16.0\\r\\n\\r\\nBug first occurs at version 8.6.0\\r\\nThe bug does not occur in 8.5.5\\r\\n\\r\\n**Describe the bug**\\r\\n<!--A clear and concise description of what the bug is.-->\\r\\n\\r\\nI have a rule that polishes a nanopore genome. This polishing rule leads to a series of other rules, which activate a checkpoint. After checkpoint DAG generation, the polishing rule is again run on a subset of contigs in a different directory. The polishing rule uses wild cards for which directory to run: either the original polishing directory (before the checkpoint) or a later circularization directory (after the checkpoint).\\r\\n\\r\\nSnakemake only deletes the temp files for the first polishing rule invocation after the checkpoint (in the circularization directory) but doesn't delete the temp files from when the file was initially invoked (in the polishing directory). It also does not delete any temp file generated before the checkpoint (this may be my use case), even if they are not needed after the checkpoint. Running snakemake with flag `--delete-temp-output` deletes these files.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore 8.6.0 snakemake would delete the temp files for both rules, which is the expected behavior for this use case because these temp files are not needed for later steps, even after DAG regeneration.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis bug appears to occur between [8.5.5](https://github.com/snakemake/snakemake/releases/tag/v8.5.5) and [8.6.0](https://github.com/snakemake/snakemake/releases/tag/v8.6.0). Specifically, the release for 8.6.0 mentions https://github.com/snakemake/snakemake/issues/2732 being fixed by https://github.com/snakemake/snakemake/pull/2737 (fix premature deletion of temp files in combination with checkpoints). I believe the bug was introduced during this pull request.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Logs**\\r\\n<!--If applicable, any terminal output to help explain your problem.-->\\r\\n\\r\\nTODO\\r\\n\\r\\n**Minimal example**\\r\\n<!--Add a minimal example for reproducing the bug.-->\\r\\n\\r\\nTODO --> The pipeline is pretty complex, so getting a simplified example may take some time.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere is the complete rule. _R1.clean.sam and _R2.clean.sam, as well as temp files in rules leading up to this rule, are not deleted if they are outputs of the rule when invoked before the checkpoint.
