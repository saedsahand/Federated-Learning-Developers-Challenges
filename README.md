# Federated-Learning-Developers-Challenges
In this study, we have explored the FL developers challenges by analyzing the Stack Overflow posts and GitHub issues. First, we have gathered all the relevant data to FL and have preprocessed and postprocessed it. Afterwards, we have done the topic modeling to figure out the topics that the developers might face with BERT Topic modeling.
